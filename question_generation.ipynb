      "India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[377] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928â€“29, is the best known.[378][379] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[379][380] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins.\n"
